#<Bootcamp Prework Webpage>

## Description 

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- This was the first learning experince I recieved from the bootcamp covering all main suject areas to Full stack development.
- Completing the prework for bootcamp was to ensure that I had some basic knowledge of coding with, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git before undergoing a 6 month fast paced course.
- I belive these tasks that I have completed over the past few weeks have ensured that I have the knowledge that I need to begin class
- Since starting my prework I have learned more that I expected, I now have a working knowledge of HTML and CCS. I also have learned quite a bit about Javascript but it does seem to be marginally more difficult to comprehend than HTML and CSS. Also, I now have a very good understanding of GIT functions in the CLI as well as the GitHub repsoitories and branches.


If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This study guide will be able to give you some key information on all of the aspects covered in the prework. This is a very basic study guide that does not dive too deep in, but the key takeaways that I have found from HTML, CSS, Javascript and GIT are displayed. Each text box has its own list of what I belive to be key information about all 4 areas covered in the prework. You can find HTML key points at the top, with CSS, GIT, and Javascript to follow. 


## Credits

N/A

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
